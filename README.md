I devloped this app in 7days for an interview with a small firm.

It was devloped using PhoneGap opensource code, and the Twitter bootstrap. 
The backend connects to a Parse cloud storage to put and retrive contacts input unique users.

This code base shold be seen as example of what you can ask a Newb web devloper to do in 7 days and nothing more. 

I do not claim responsibility for the robustness of this code in any way. Don't trust it.

This is just here for me to validate that one week where I worked on nothing else but this for ~120 ours. 

If you are asked to do the same strange task for an interview process; Go ahead and look, but ye be warned.
