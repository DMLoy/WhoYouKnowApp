I devloped this app in 7days for fun. 

It was devloped using PhoneGap opensource code, and the Twitter bootstrap. 
The backend connects to a Parse cloud storage via API using javascript to put and retrive contacts.

This code base shold be seen as example of what you can ask a JR Web Devloper to do in 7 days. 

This is just here for me to validate that one week where I worked on nothing else but this for ~120 ours. 

If you are asked to do the same strange task for an interview process; Go ahead and look, but ye be warned.
